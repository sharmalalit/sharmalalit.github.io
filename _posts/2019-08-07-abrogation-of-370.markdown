BJP led NDA with support of other mainstream parties abolished temporary provision in Constitution of India.

So, this is what happened.

1. Governor of J&K has all powers of legislative assembly as per article 92 of scrapped J&K state constitution. 
2. Governor of J&K requested President of India to remove article 370 as per President's power in Article 370 part 3.
3. As their is no "Constituent assembly" present in J&K, President in it's order made the correction to read it as "Legislative assembly" in article 370. 
Constituent assembly was dissolved in 1956 after constitution of J&K was created.
4. BJP led parties voted to adopt these President resolutions.
5. Based on above points, President issued the public gazette to abolish Article 370 and Article 35A. There was no need for Constitution Amendment as steps to remove Article 370 were mentioned in article itself. 
6. BJP led parties submitted and passed a new bill named J&K Re-organization bill to convert the J&K state into 2 UTs. Ladakh region was asking to be converted to UT since independence.
J&K area was converted into UT to better handle terrorism and development of this region.

This move will help India to make it's better claim to full J&K area. Due to Article 370, separatist agenda was being used by Pakistan and Hurriyat leaders to cause tension in the valley. 

In the whole 2 days of debate in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, no opposition leader was able to explain the benefits of Article 370 to the parliament.
Every opposition leader was just saying that how immoral way BJP led government has used to abrogate article 370. 
Even, Congress govt divided Andhra Pradesh into 2 states  after state assembly passed the resolution multiple times to not do it. 
While the Andra Pradesh act was passed in Parliament all opposition members were marshaled out and doors were closed with no telecast.

All the constitution amendments since independence, all schemes and laws of India will now apply to J&K. Very basic and humane laws were not present in J&K. 
People of all religions, breeds, caste & color live happily in all parts of India - Why do we think it won't happen for J&K citizens?

Thanks for reading this.
